**Important note**:
This package has the same name as another package that used to be quite well known. That one seems to have been renamed to Oboe. The original was located at https://github.com/kmaasrud/obsidian-html and later https://github.com/kmaasrud/oboe which you find referenced in a lot of places. We would link to it but we can't find an authoritative source, only forks.
